# Employee Management System

Welcome to Employee Management System which is a React-based web application, I designed to manage employee records efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, viewing, updating, and filtering employee information. 

This application is deployed using GitHub Pages and uses React Router for client-side routing, while the back-end is hosted using AWS.

Front-end would be accessible through this URL
